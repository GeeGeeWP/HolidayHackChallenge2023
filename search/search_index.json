It's a pretty nifty tool, but there are a few issues in the output that I've noticed. I need some guidance in finding any errors in the way it generated the content, especially those odd hallucinations in the LLM output. I know it's not perfect, but I'd really appreciate the extra eyes on this one. Some of the issues might be subtle, so don't be afraid to dig deep and ask for further clarification if you're unsure. I've heard that you folks are experts about LLM outputs and their common issues, so I trust you can help me with this. Your input will be invaluable to me, so please feel free to share any insights or findings you may have.

I think I last saw him on Pixel island. By the way, as part of the Azure documentation he sent the elves, Alabaster also noted that if Azure CLI tools aren't available in an Azure VM we should use the Azure REST API instead.
