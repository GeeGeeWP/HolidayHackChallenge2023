**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective 3 terminal](https://.../)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Speak with Chimney Scissorsticks on Steampunk Island about the interesting things the captain is hearing on his new Software Defined Radio. You'll need to assume the GeeseIslandsSuperChiefCommunicationsOfficer role.

??? quote "Chimney Scissorsticks"
    Ahoy there, I'm Chimney Scissorsticks!


??? quote "Chimney Scissorsticks"
    You may have noticed some mischief-makers planning to stir up trouble ashore.<br>
    They've made many radio broadcasts which the captain has been monitoring with his new software defined radio (SDR).<br>
    The new SDR uses some fancy JWT technology to control access.<br>
    The captain has a knack for shortening words, some sorta abbreviation trick.<br>
    Not familiar with JWT values? No worries; just think of it as a clue-solving game.<br>
    I've seen that the Captain likes to carry his journal with him wherever he goes.<br>
    If only I could find the planned "go-date", "go-time", and radio frequency they plan to use.<br>
    Remember, the captain's abbreviations are your guiding light through this mystery!<br>
    Once we find a JWT value, these villains won't stand a chance.<br>
    The closer we are, the sooner we'll be thwarting their pesky plans!<br>
    We need to recreate an administrative JWT value to successfully transmit a message.<br>
    Good luck, matey! I've no doubts about your cleverness in cracking this conundrum!

Use [admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/), [images](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/), [diagrams](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/), [code blocks](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/), and [tables](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/data-tables/) to highlight and structure important information or provide additional clarification.

### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
