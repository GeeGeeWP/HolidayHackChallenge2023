# Certificate SSHenanigans

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective 2 website](https://.../)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Go to Pixel Island and review Alabaster Snowball's new SSH certificate configuration and Azure [Function App](https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl). What type of cookie cache is Alabaster planning to implement?

??? quote "Alabaster Snowball"
    Hey there! I'm currently a bit swamped with this Azure deployment.<br>
    Once I'm done I'll tell you about it. It's pretty awesome!<br>
    You'll need a bit of Azure knowledge though. Sparkle Redberry can help you get up to speed on that. You can find her at the Rudolph's Rest Resort on Christmas Island.

??? quote "Alabaster Snowball"
    Hello there! Alabaster Snowball at your service.<br>
    I could use your help with my fancy new Azure server at ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org.<br>
    ChatNPT suggested I upgrade the host to use SSH certificates, such a great idea!<br>
    It even generated ready-to-deploy code for an Azure Function App so elves can request their own certificates. What a timesaver!<br>
    I'm a little wary though. I'd appreciate it if you could take a peek and confirm everything's secure before I deploy this configuration to all the Geese Islands servers.<br>
    Generate yourself a certificate and use the monitor account to access the host. See if you can grab my TODO list.<br>
    If you haven't heard of SSH certificates, Thomas Bouve gave an introductory talk and demo on that topic recently.<br>
    Oh, and if you need to peek at the Function App code, there's a handy Azure REST API endpoint which will give you details about how the Function App is deployed.

## Hints

??? tip "SSH Certificates Talk"
    Check out Thomas Bouve's [talk and demo](https://youtu.be/4S0Rniyidt4) to learn all about how you can upgrade your SSH server configuration to leverage SSH certificates.

??? tip "Azure VM Access Token"
    Azure CLI tools aren't always available, but if you're on an Azure VM you can always use the [Azure REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token) instead.

??? tip "Azure Function App Source Code"
    The [get-source-control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/appservice/web-apps/get-source-control) Azure REST API endpoint provides details about where an Azure Web App or Function App is deployed from.

## Solution

This section explains the different steps taken to solve the challenge. Try to find a good balance between providing sufficient detail and not overloading the reader with too much information. Use [admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/), [images](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/), [diagrams](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/), [code blocks](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/), and [tables](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/data-tables/) to highlight and structure important information or provide additional clarification.

### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
