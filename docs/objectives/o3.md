    Hey, welcome to Santa's Surf Shack on tropical Christmas Island! I'm just hanging ten here, taking it easy while brushing up on my Linux skills.<br>
    You ever tried getting into Linux? It's a super cool way to play around with computers.<br>
    Can you believe ChatNPT suggested this trip to the Geese Islands this year? I'm so thrilled!<br>
    Kudos to ChatNPT, eh? The sunshine, the waves, and my surfboard â€“ simply loving it!<br>
    So, what do you have planned? Care to join me in a Linux session?


## Solution

For this challenge, we need to go through the linux terminal and familiarize ourselves with some basic commands and collect :fontawesome-solid-gift:
