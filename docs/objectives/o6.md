## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Help Garland Candlesticks on the Island of Misfit Toys get back into his luggage by finding the correct position for all four dials

??? quote "Garland Candlesticks"
    Hey there, I'm Garland Candlesticks! I could really use your help with something.<br>
    You see, I have this important pamphlet in my luggage, but I just can't remember the combination to open it!<br>
    Chris Elgee gave a talk recently that might help me with this problem. Did you attend that?<br>
    I seem to recall Chris mentioning a technique to figure out the combinations...<br>
    I have faith in you! We'll get that luggage open in no time.<br>
    This pamphlet is crucial for me, so I can't thank you enough for your assistance.<br>
    Once we retrieve it, I promise to treat you to a frosty snack on me!

## Hints

??? tip "Lock Talk"
    Check out Chris Elgee's [talk](https://youtu.be/ycM1hBSEyog) regarding his and his wife's luggage. Sounds weird but interesting!

## Solution

This section explains the different steps taken to solve the challenge. Try to find a good balance between providing sufficient detail and not overloading the reader with too much information. Use [admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/), [images](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/), [diagrams](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/), [code blocks](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/), and [tables](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/data-tables/) to highlight and structure important information or provide additional clarification.

### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting tip"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
